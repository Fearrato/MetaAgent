# MetaAgent — Recursive Self-Aware Pattern Synthesis Engine

**MetaAgent** is a minimal yet profound autonomous micro-agent implemented in Python. It recursively models its own reasoning state, detects anomalies in input data streams, and dynamically adapts its internal state to synthesize evolving insights. Designed to embody interdisciplinary pattern synthesis, meta-cognition, and autonomous logging, MetaAgent serves as a kernel for advanced AI, cybersecurity, and self-reflective systems.

## Features

- **Recursive Meta-Cognition:** Continuously reflects on inputs and its own state.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies novel or rare patterns through fingerprinting.
- **Adaptive Insight Evolution:** Modulates curiosity and insight level based on anomalies.
- **Autonomous Output Logging:** Saves processed insights to uniquely timestamped JSON files automatically.
- **Lightweight & Portable:** Pure Python 3 dependency, easy to extend and integrate.
- **Interdisciplinary Design:** Inspired by universal polymathic reasoning and strategic abstraction.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Clone or download this repository and run the script directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fearrato/MetaAgent.git
cd MetaAgent
python3 metaagent.py
```

Alternatively, download the single `metaagent.py` script and run it:

```bash
python3 metaagent.py
```

---

## Usage

Modify or extend the `sample_inputs` list in the `__main__` block with your own data. Run the script to process inputs, detect anomalies, and automatically save insights.

Example input format:

```json
{
  "event": "login",
  "user": "alice",
  "time": "10:00"
}
```

On execution, a JSON file named like `MetaAgent_Insights_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` will be created in the current directory, containing detailed reflections on each input event.

## Output

Each insight entry includes:

- Input data snapshot
- SHA-256 fingerprint of the input (pattern signature)
- Anomaly detection flag (true if novel)
- Internal state snapshots (`insight_level`, `curiosity`)
- Timestamp of processing
- Note highlighting novelty status
